Cattermelon, the developer behind Hectagon Finance, has announced the launch of Syncvote, a platform designed to increase community participation for crypto projects by 10x and reduce manual administrative tasks for community leaders by 90%.

To build a successful and lasting protocol in Web3, progressive decentralization through community participation is vital. 99.99% of protocols will fail because they lack the proper tools for the job. The current DAO community is strung together by numerous independent platforms and rules of engagement defined in text-based posts pinned on the forum that are confusing to navigate and impossible to audit. As a result, community members settle for management by abdication, and DAOs become inefficient, unorganized, and victims of their own value.

(Why DAO matters? [[the future of work is not Corporate — it's DAOs and crypto networks\|the future of work is not Corporate — it's DAOs and crypto networks]] and [[the digital leviathan\|the digital leviathan]])

Syncvote gives DAO leaders and members the ability to change from a text-based rules of engagement to a multi-step workflow format. Once deployed, the workflow cannot be stopped or changed by centralized power, so DAO members can be confident that their DAO rules will not suddenly change overnight.

A good use case is for DAOs to deploy a Community Engagement Workflow. Any eligible DAO member can use that workflow to run their own Community Engagement campaign permissionlessly.

Workflows can also be completely automated. For example, DAOs can deploy a workflow that guides new members to onboard themselves into the community on Discord, Telegram, Discourse...

DAO members also no longer have to remember where to go to see what as they can just go on Syncvote and see all the workflows their community has and reach the correct tool as needed.

Workflows also give DAO communities the ability to systematically look back step by step and review what worked to make changes and improve future processes. It empowered member to autonomously make contributions and improvements to their DAO overtime.

Syncvote also enables DAOs to discover and copy proven workflows of others, making the learning experience not only within a DAO but also across DAOs.

"Our team encountered firsthand the frustration of running a DAO. The current experience sucks for us as adins and also for our community members," said K2, CTO of Cattermelon. "Syncvote is a breakthrough for DAOs by providing the ability to quickly codify their workflow so progressive decentralization can be achieved over time."

"Syncvote has transformed the way we manage our investment processes," said Jane Smith, founder of XYZ DAO. "The platform's automation capabilities have enabled us to streamline our processes and reduce the administrative workload required, which has been a huge benefit for our team. And we see a huge uptake in community participation too since they can now be involved in designing how our DAO runs."

To start using Syncvote, simply sign up at the website [syncvote.com](http://syncvote.com/). It employs a pay-as-you-go system, so users only need to pay for what they use. For most communities, a budget of $20 monthly is enough to get started.
