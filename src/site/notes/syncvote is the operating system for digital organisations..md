We are building SyncVote, the [[operating system\|operating system]] for all future [[digital organisations\|digital organisations]].
Our thesis is that DAO is the killer application of Blockchain, increasing human cooperation and productivity significantly. You can read more about my thesis, named [[the digital leviathan\|the digital leviathan]].
  
Thus, SyncVote is the tool to build that vision. You can use SyncVote to design and publish a Workflow on Solana Blockchain. Later on, every time you use this workflow, you are assured that every step happens as it is designed in a single simple user interface. Furthermore, you have data to improve your workflow and shuffle people to make them thrive. Changing workflow is no longer a manual process that takes months to implement but a simple click. SyncVote data is on-chain and owned by users; there is no user-locked, and you are free to use other interfaces as you wish or analyse the data in any way you want to improve your organisation.
