    - DeFi
    - GameFi

    - Running a protocol DAO is very much like running a public company where the core-team is BOD and the token holders/DAO members are shareholders. Whereas, DAO members normally donâ€™t work for the core business and product development of the project, but they have a say in making the main decisions like directions, strategy, key changesâ€¦ based on their token holding power.
    - The DAO can also run some campaigns and bounty to seek for contributions from their DAO members.

The support and advocacy of DAO members is always in needed to make sure the protocol is driven and developed towards the best directions.

### Key takeaways

**The recommended group of target customers to acquire as early adopters are:**

**** (1) Purpose-driven DAO 

 (4) Purpose-driven community 

**The recommendation is based on 3 factors:**

1. The nature of the 2 groups matches their problems to our value proposition, making their reasons of why they should try out our product is the most concrete.
    
    > _Problems: The main problem DAO leaders are facing is fragmented interface between different apps and tools to run their DAO. From communication, documentation, treasury management, voting, discussion... can easily add up to ~10 different apps. Itâ€™s hard for DAO leaders to manage and cost them a lot of admin time, while also hard for DAO members to follow & not miss out on the most important activities and documents. The real challenge for DAO leaders is not only they have to setup the system, they also need to solve the problem of how they can make their system user (DAO members) friendly, which is a very hard thing to do._
    
    > _Value proposition: A platform that help DAO leaders build a seamless management system and a friendly user (member) experience._
    
2. The technical limitation at the moment only allows up to some thousands users to vote on-chain on the same proposal (which is not satisfactory for some big Protocol DAO cases).
    
3. These are the customers segments that are underserved properly by other tools, so the competition is also less fierce.
