An organisation has two parts:
- The hierarchy of human within it
- Protocols for how stakeholders of an organisation work together and create value

Let's take an example of a corner food shop:
The shop might be small; a store owner will be the cashier, a waiter/waitress and a chief. There are other stakeholders: customers and suppliers. The hierarchy inside the shop is simple: all employees listen to what the boss says. Outside, there is no hierarchy, but contracts.
Inside the shop, most things running in the shop have their protocol. Who is going to clean the shop in the morning? The chief and the waiter/waitress take every other weekday; the weekend is the boss's job. Customers have protocols to follow in the shop: eat the food, pay the money and behave well. If one has to write down all the processes running in a small shop, it will take days, so most of the time, people skip it or stick some simple rule into the wall and call it a day.

Nothing is wrong with this brick-and-mortar shop working magically under the boss's rules and having a minimum number of rules written down. However, as organisations grow and stakeholders interact digitally, the need for both hierarchy and protocol to be visual and strictly imposed is increasingly essential.
Governments are typical examples of big organisations that need hundreds of thousands of clerks to keep the machine well-oiled. For instance, in the US, there are 1.5 million clerks and administrators in the government (https://www-statista-com.ezproxy.library.qmul.ac.uk/statistics/317598/number-of-bookkeeping-accounting-and-auditing-clerks-employed-us/); in the UK, the number is around 420 thousand (https://www-statista-com.ezproxy.library.qmul.ac.uk/statistics/776940/individuals-employed-in-administrative-occupations-in-finance-uk/). Or, it takes 0.3% of the population in the US and 0.6% of population in the UK.

The digitalisation both hierarchy and protocols of organisations are key for its efficiency and success.
