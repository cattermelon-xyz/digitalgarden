Why I think Trello and Jira looks like my competitor?

Because of their interfaces. Let's look at Trello:

In syncvote language, the column format is a workflow.
"To Do -> Research -> In Progress -> Review -> Completed"
The workflow can be displayed like this:

Each node can be configured clearly on who can make the decision and when it should be made.
Each card in Trello represent a "mission" in SyncVote, each has a history of decisions have been made on it.

The reason why I think Jira is similar to SyncVote because it has a very similar workflow editor

However, neither Trello and Jira enable a global-scale cooperation that SyncVote aims at through the immutable and transparency nature of Blockchain.
