DAO starts with community, to be precise: A community use DAO technology and techniques to bond its members.
A community will start with an **Interest**, e.g.: learning about new technology, sharing a common interest in a celebrity, a hobby (e.g.: reading a book), etc.
However, interest-only does not make a community thrive. A community need a **Purpose** to make its members unite and make an impact on the world, which makes the bond stronger.

For example:

- A fan club can hold a birthday party for its celebrity, host a trip for its members to join a concert, or even fund a team to make a movie about their celebrity.
- A book-lover community can fund a team to translate its long-love book into their native language, fund a team to open a book coffee that meets their style or build libraries in remote and poor areas.
People can do a lot of crazy things for their love; they only need a tool.

## What is a DAO?

A DAO is a **community** built in the digital age so it is a **Digital-first Organization**. Most of its members meet and bond online (with no border).
A Digital-first Organization can reach a global audience from day 1. However, the principle stays the same: a community's quality stays with its quality, not the quantity of members.
This community will use **Crypto technology** to facilitate its multiple **Purposes**. Smart Contract is a good tool for a community to raise funds and set transparent rules to work toward its purpose. Coincidentally, transparency is the best way to earn trust and make community members stay. Doing just that, you get a decentralized autonomous organisation** (DAO).

Smart Contracts resisted change by design. Thus, a DAO's purpose must be obvious and time-bound so the smart contract does not get obsoleted and obstruct the operation of DAO's members.

## How to build a DAO?

You don't build a DAO from nothing, you build a DAO from a community. So, these are the steps:

### **Step 1:**

You build a community. There are many guideline on how to build a community, take this one for example:[Tips on How to Build a Community \| CMX](https://cmxhub.com/how-build-new-community/)
By building a community, you identify your stakeholders: who are they? what is their need? etc. Knowing your audience is the foundation of your future activities.

### Step 2:

You run your community and you make your life easier by implementing Crypto technology (if it really make your life easier).
Does your community want to pool money together to invest in web3? Yay, let's build a Decentralized Venture Capital.

Does your community want to build kick-ass product on Crypto? Let's fund builder to do so.

Does your community want to buy the original Constitution-copy? Let's do it.

Does your community want to build bridge in a remote village in Africa? Err, if crypto technology make your life easier then go for it. Otherwise, stay away from Crypto.

There are 2 phases of running a DAO:
- Build a Treasury 
- Aggregate the collective wills of its members
- Enforce the will through power of Treasury
## Conclusion

DAO is a great tool to leverage online community collaboration. One day, DAO can help solve some of the humongous problems for humanity such as: Climate change, Energy crisis, a healthy Global Trade route, bring human to Mars and beyond, etc.
However, let's start small. Look around you, find a community that is in need and introduce Crypto to them. That's might be one small step for man, but **one giant leap for mankind**.
