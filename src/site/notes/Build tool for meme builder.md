Meme builders are community leaders by definition!

The power of memes is immense, and we are only seeing the beginning of it.
What is their nature and tools?
[ ] Fast, no-brainer setup
[ ] Telegram over Discord
[ ] Love decentralisation ~ it is all meme is about
[ ] A lot of chatting, non-stop ~ at least at the beginning
[ ] Obsessed with growth

What workflow should I provide them (in priority order)?
[ ] Kick or keep someone in the group chat
[ ] Airdrop to other token holder communities for marketing
[ ] Activity proposal to spend some fund
[ ] Control of the official social account
Other than workflow, what is cool?
[ ] An AI that sits in group chat (telegram) read everything + Read all material from the organisation (official social account, website + docs, social account of important members) => acts as an assistant for members to discover information. Can exists in form of a chatbot.
[] Shit post to keep the social account vibrant, maybe go through simple checkpoint to make sure it is not too shitty
